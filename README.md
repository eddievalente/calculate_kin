#Kin Calculation

In the context of Mayan astrology, the "kin" is the number corresponding to a day in the Tzolkin calendar, which consists of 260 days (20 signs Ã— 13 numbers). To calculate the kin of a birth date, we follow the steps to convert the date to the Mayan calendar format and find the position in the Tzolkin cycle.

The Tzolkin cycle organizes the days in a cyclical manner. Each element (day name, tone, color) repeats at regular intervals within the 260-day cycle.

The Mayan Tzolkin cycle does not consider leap days, because it is a calendar based on a fixed cycle of 260 days. It is not tied directly to the solar year or the Gregorian calendar, which is where leap days appear as an adjustment.

When calculating the Kin for modern dates, we use a reference point in the Gregorian calendar (such as January 1, 1970). Although the Gregorian calendar takes leap years into account, this only affects the counting of days between the date of birth and the reference point. This count already takes leap days into account, but does not change the fixed 260-day sequence of the Tzolkin.
